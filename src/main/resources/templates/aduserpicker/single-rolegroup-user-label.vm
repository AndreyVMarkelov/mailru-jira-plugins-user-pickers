## this is very much a hack - and assumes a lot of things about how a custom field works.
## please ensure that this will work for you before you use this template.
## NOTE: This only has to put the urlPrefix in the href now since the url
## passed in has become much smarter and has already accounted for the custom
## fields value.
#if ($value)
#if ($urlPrefix && $urlPrefix != '')
<a href="${urlPrefix}">$textutils.htmlEncode($value.displayName)</a>
#else
$cfValueEncoder.encodeForHtml($value.displayName)
